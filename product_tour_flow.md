# Generic SaaS Application Product Tour Flow & Storyboard

This document outlines a generic interactive product tour flow suitable for a typical SaaS application. The tour aims to quickly orient new users to the main areas and key functionalities.

## Tour Flow Steps

---

### Step 1: Welcome & Dashboard Overview

*   **Target UI Element CSS Selector:** `#dashboard-welcome-message` or `.dashboard-hero-section`
*   **Title/Heading:** "Welcome to Your Dashboard!"
*   **Description:** This is your central hub where you can see important updates, key metrics, and quick links to common actions. Get an at-a-glance view of your activity.
*   **Micro-interaction Notes:**
    *   Use a spotlight effect to dim the rest of the page, focusing on the welcome message/hero section.
    *   The tour popover/modal appears with a smooth fade-in animation.
    *   "Next" button on the tour popover can have a subtle pulse to encourage progression.

### Step 2: Discover a Core Feature

*   **Target UI Element CSS Selector:** `#main-feature-button` or `.core-feature-navigation-link`
*   **Title/Heading:** "Explore [Core Feature Name]" (e.g., "Create Your First Project")
*   **Description:** This is where you can access [Core Feature Name], a key tool to help you [achieve primary value proposition]. Click here to start exploring its capabilities.
*   **Micro-interaction Notes:**
    *   The target button/link should have a pulsating hotspot animation to draw attention.
    *   On hover (before click, if tour allows), the element could slightly enlarge or change background color.
    *   If the tour requires a click to proceed, provide visual feedback on click (e.g., ripple effect).

### Step 3: Understanding Navigation / Key Section

*   **Target UI Element CSS Selector:** `#main-navigation-menu` or `#secondary-feature-module`
*   **Title/Heading:** "Navigate Key Sections" or "Understanding [Section Name]"
*   **Description:** Use the main navigation menu to easily switch between different sections of the application, like [Example Section 1] and [Example Section 2].
*   **Micro-interaction Notes:**
    *   Highlight the entire navigation bar or the specific module.
    *   If highlighting menu items sequentially, use a smooth transition or pointing arrow.
    *   Tooltips could appear briefly if hovering over individual menu items (if tour is passive at this stage).

---

### Step 4: Manage Your Account & Profile

*   **Target UI Element CSS Selector:** `#user-profile-menu` or `.avatar-dropdown-trigger`
*   **Title/Heading:** "Manage Your Account"
*   **Description:** Access your profile information, account settings, billing details, and help resources from this menu.
*   **Micro-interaction Notes:**
    *   The user avatar or profile icon can have a subtle glow or bounce effect to attract attention.
    *   When the tour points to it, simulate a hover effect if it's a dropdown to show what it expands to, or guide the user to click.

### Step 5 (Optional): Customization/Settings

*   **Target UI Element CSS Selector:** `#settings-panel-link` or `.app-preferences-icon`
*   **Title/Heading:** "Customize Your Experience"
*   **Description:** Tailor the application to your needs by adjusting settings, preferences, and notification options here.
*   **Micro-interaction Notes:**
    *   Similar to other steps, use a pulsating hotspot or highlight on the settings link/icon.
    *   The tour popover could emphasize the benefit of customization.
    *   A "Finish Tour" button on this last step could have a celebratory micro-animation (e.g., icon changes to a checkmark) upon click.

This generic flow provides a basic structure. It should be adapted based on the specific SaaS application's complexity, primary features, and the most critical first actions a new user should take to find value.
