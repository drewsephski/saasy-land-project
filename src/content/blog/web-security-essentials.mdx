# Web Security Essentials

Web security is paramount in today's digital landscape. As developers, it's our responsibility to build applications that protect user data and maintain integrity. This post covers essential web security concepts and common vulnerabilities.

## 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious scripts into web content viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.

**Prevention:**
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user input.
- **Output Encoding:** Encode data before rendering it in HTML to prevent script execution.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a CSP to restrict the sources from which content can be loaded.

## 2. SQL Injection

SQL Injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution.

**Prevention:**
- **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation to build SQL queries.
- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user input that interacts with your database.
- **Least Privilege:** Grant database users only the necessary permissions.

## 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

CSRF attacks trick a victim into submitting a malicious request. It exploits the trust that a web application has in an authenticated user's browser.

**Prevention:**
- **CSRF Tokens:** Include a unique, unpredictable token in each request that the server verifies.
- **SameSite Cookies:** Use the `SameSite` attribute for cookies to prevent them from being sent with cross-site requests.
- **Referer Header Check:** Verify the `Referer` header to ensure requests originate from your domain (less reliable).

## 4. Secure Authentication and Authorization

Properly implementing authentication and authorization is critical for security.

- **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Encourage or require MFA.
- **Session Management:** Use secure, short-lived session tokens and invalidate them on logout.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement clear roles and permissions.

## 5. HTTPS Everywhere

Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server. This protects data in transit from eavesdropping and tampering.

By understanding and mitigating these common web security risks, developers can build more robust and trustworthy applications.
