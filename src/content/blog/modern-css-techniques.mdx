# Modern CSS Techniques

CSS has evolved significantly, offering powerful features for creating complex and responsive layouts with less code. Here are some modern CSS techniques every web developer should know.

## 1. CSS Grid Layout

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to design complex responsive web design layouts more easily and consistently across browsers. It's ideal for main page layouts.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```

## 2. Flexbox

While Grid is for two-dimensional layouts, Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system, perfect for distributing space among items in a single row or column. It's great for component-level layouts.

```css
.navbar {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## 3. CSS Custom Properties (Variables)

CSS variables allow you to define reusable values throughout your stylesheets, making it easier to manage design systems and themes.

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #007bff;
  --text-color: #333;
}

body {
  color: var(--text-color);
}

.button {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
}
```

## 4. `clamp()` for Responsive Typography

The `clamp()` CSS function lets you set a minimum, preferred, and maximum value for a CSS property. It's particularly useful for responsive typography, ensuring text scales beautifully across different screen sizes.

```css
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 4rem);
}
```

## 5. Logical Properties

Logical properties and values provide the ability to control layout and position based on the flow of content, rather than physical directions (like `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`). This is crucial for internationalization and accessibility.

```css
.element {
  margin-inline-start: 20px; /* Equivalent to margin-left in LTR, margin-right in RTL */
  padding-block-end: 10px; /* Equivalent to padding-bottom */
}
```

By incorporating these modern CSS techniques, you can build more robust, flexible, and maintainable web designs.
